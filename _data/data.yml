        company: Naval Nuclear Laboratory, Niskayuna, NY
        details: |
          Designed a robotic arm based contamination detection system for a radiological glovebox facility.
          The system used a Universal Robots UR3e collaborative robot in order reduce operator fatigue.
          Developed a strategy for the introduction of robotics into nuclear hot cells.
      - role: Electrical Engineer - Shipboard Electrical Systems
        time: June 2019 - September 2022
        company: Naval Nuclear Laboratory, Niskayuna, NY
        details: |
          Cognizant engineer of the Smart Display, the Human Machine Interface for the next generation Generic
          Instrumentation and Control system. Cognizant engineer responsibilities entailed prototyping, 
          specification development, and involving gaining and integrating stakeholder feedback from design
          and end user organizations across the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program. I identified and introduced
          a new ruggedized display vendor to the Program.

          Developed test platform using commercial development boards to mimic shipboard communication interfaces
          used across the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program for next generation Generic Instrumentation and 
          Control processor card development. Provided support for end users and made updates based on their feedback.
