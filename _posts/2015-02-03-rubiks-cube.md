I am working on with a few friends a design for a Rubik's cube solving robot using the Lego Mindstorms ev3 kit. We got the original spark of inspiration from the MindCub3r project which you can check out at [www.mindcuber.com](http://www.mindcuber.com). Those robots work nicely but we figured that we could improve on the time it takes to solve the cube by improving the mechanical design. Our goal is to build a bot comparable to David Gilday's current [world record holder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO5DLbpp3-M).

We've built the model for the original Mindstorms NXT robot and have now built it for the new Mindstorms ev3 model. Once we get the mechanics of the robot fully built, I'll make a new post with designs of the robot attached. We really believe in sharing our work with the community at large. Eventually we might even decide to release code but I cannot make any promises there. The code will most likely be in my school's Robotics github which is available at [github.com/hhs-robotics](https://github.com/hhs-robotics). There's nothing there right now.

As for the programming aspect of it, we plan to use Java as provided through the lejos-EV3 project. I have some experience with the old NXT version and the new EV3 version. I'm working through some example tutorials right now in order to really figure out how lejos works. As they say, the best way to learn is by doing.

Oh and one last thing, post frequency will definitely start to increase as I begin to make projects I feel are worth sharing. You can always check out my public github in the meantime (@draab)[https://github.com/draab] to see what I am up to. Keep in mind, most of my good work is in private repositories. I'm working on releasing some of the better stuff to the public.
